# ROCK-PAPPER-SICSSOR
a rock-paper-scissor web classification app
This is a simple image classification web app to predict whether an image of a hand formed a shape of rock, paper, or scissor.

The model for the web app was trained with the rps dataset from Laurence Moroney. This is a synthetic dataset of computer generated human hands with different colors that formed either rock, paper, or scissor.
